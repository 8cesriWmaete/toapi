One of the highlights of Bitwig Studio 3.1.2 is the new Micro-pitch device, which allows you to dynamically retune notes, import existing scales and define your own. You can fine-tune individual notes, transform scales, shrink or expand octaves, play notes that you would never have imagined. You can also load Scala (SCL) files directly into the Micro-pitch device, or explore any of the 30+ presets based on historic and cultural temperaments.
 
Another new feature in Bitwig Studio 3.1.2 is the Pitch-12 modulator, which provides a modulation signal when any note type is being pressed (C, D, etc.). This can be used to trigger unique effects on âoutâ notes, or take classic ideas in a new direction. You can also use the Pitch-12 modulator with MPE-Ready VST plug-ins, as well as with hardware via CV.
 
Bitwig Studio 3.1.2 also brings interactive help for all devices in Bitwig Studio, not just for The Grid. With it you can instantly call up documentation without leaving the creative zone.
