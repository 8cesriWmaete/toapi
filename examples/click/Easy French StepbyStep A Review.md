## What does the book cover?
 
The book consists of 15 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of French grammar. The chapters are organized in order of importance and difficulty, starting with the basics such as articles, nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, and progressing to more complex topics such as verb tenses, moods, and modes, negation, interrogatives, and subordination.
 
Each chapter begins with a clear explanation of the grammatical rules and concepts, followed by a list of common verbs and their conjugations. Then, there are several exercises to practice what you have learned, ranging from fill-in-the-blanks to translation. The exercises are accompanied by answer keys at the end of the book. Finally, each chapter ends with a reading passage that illustrates the grammar points in context and introduces some vocabulary and culture.
